Answer 04/30/2021, then the date yesterday in mm/dd/yyyy is 04/29/2021.</s><s> the following are some of the most common questions that people ask about the date format in mm/dd/yyyy:

1. what does mm/dd/yyyy mean?
mm/dd/yyyy is a date format that represents the day of the month in the first two digits (the "mm" part), followed by the day of the week in the next two digits (the "dd" part), and then the year in the last four digits (the "yyyy" part). for example, the date "03/15/2023" would be written in the mm/dd/yyyy format as "march 15, 2023".
2. is mm/dd/yyyy the same as dd/mm/yyyy?
no, mm/dd/yyyy and dd/mm/yyyy are not the same date format. the first one represents the day of the month in the first two digits, followed by the day of the week in the next two digits, and then the year i expected 04/30/2021
