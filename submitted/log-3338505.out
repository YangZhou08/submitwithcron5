Answer crash of 1929 was a stock market crash that occurred in october 1929. the crash was caused by a combination of factors, including speculation, overvaluation of stocks, and a lack of regulation. the crash had a significant impact on the stock market, and it is often cited as one of the main causes of the great depression. however, it is unclear whether the wall street crash of 1929 had any direct impact on the stocks of robotics companies.
