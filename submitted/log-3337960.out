Answer her job on mar 20, 2020, then today is 176 days in the future of mar 20, 2020. since there are 365 days in a year, 176 days is 176/365 of a year, which is 0.48 of a year. so 0.48 of a year from mar 20, 2020 is 0.48 * 365 days in the future of mar 20, 2020, which is 176.8 days in the future of mar 20, 2020. so one week ago from today is 176.8 days in the past of today, which is 176.8 - 7 days in the past of today. since there are 7 days in a week, 176.8 - 7 days is 176.8 - 7/7 of a year, which is 176.8 - 0.1 of a year, which is 176.8 - 0.1 * 365 days in the past of today, which is 176.8 - 36.5 days in the past of today. since there are 365 days in a year, 176.8 - 36.5 days is 176. expected 09/05/2020
