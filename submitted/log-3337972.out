Answer her job on mar 20, 2020, then today is 176 days in the future of mar 20, 2020. since there are 365 days in a year, 176 days is 0.48 years in the future of mar 20, 2020. so today is in 0.48 years in the future of mar 20, 2020, which is in the 0.48th month of 2021. since there are 12 months in a year, 0.48 years is 0.48*12 = 5.76 months in the future of mar 20, 2020. so today is in the 0.48th month of 2021, which is in the 6th month of 2021. since there are 30 days in a month, 0.48*12 = 0.48*30 = 14.4 days in the future of mar 20, 2020. so today is in the 14.4th day of the 6th month of 2021, which is in the 15th day of june 2021. since there are 30 days in a month, expected 09/05/2020
